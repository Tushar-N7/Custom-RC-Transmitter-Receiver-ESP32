Note:
The provided transmitter and receiver codes are basic test versions created to demonstrate the core communication between the ESP32 and NRF24L01 modules.  
They are not the final or fully optimized versions of the project code.  
You can use these as a starting point to test your hardware setup and then build more advanced features on top of them.
